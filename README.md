# Hospitality-Insights-and-Analytics

## Problem Statement

For the past 20 years, Atliq Grands, a renowned network of five-star hotels in India, has been a major force in the hospitality sector. 
They have been having difficulties lately as a result of competitors' calculated moves and poor management choices, which have caused them to lose market share and money in the luxury/business hotel sector. 
To regain their market position and increase revenue, the managing director has opted to integrate "Business and Data Intelligence" in response. Atliq Grands does not, however, have an internal data analytics staff to offer these vital insights. 
In order to give them with meaningful insights based on their historical data analysis, their revenue management team has chosen to work with an outside service provider.

## Goal

1) Create the metrics according to the metric list.
2) Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
3) Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.
